##Experiment Folder

This folder contains all information about the Experiment in Psytoolkit. They should have all the materials necessary to replicate the Experiment. The details about the data collection are listed in the Excel-file "Overview_Experiments". 

Each individual subfolder contains: 

-the Slides shown in Psytoolkit
- the code in a .psy-format
- the codes of the survey and the experiment as .txt-Files
- all stimulus-Tables
- they do NOT contain the stimuli. Those can be found in the stimuli subfolder 

-Exp1-3 were student projects
- Exp 4-5 were done by CN, so the Folder contain even a few more information, like participant-consent form, pptx for slides, etc. 

- the folder contains also the zip-files of the raw data of each experiment
