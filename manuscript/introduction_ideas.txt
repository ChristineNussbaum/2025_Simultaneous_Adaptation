- different cues expressed by voices (and faces)
- linguistic, paralinguistic and extralinguistic
- some change within a conversation (words and emotions), others dont (identity and speaker sex)
- to some degree independently (shown by double dissociations in the brain etc), there is now also ample evidence for interdepentent processing 
- especially: invante cues influence changeable cues (e.g. Haxby et al 2000)
- often tested by the Garners paradigm (maybe quickly explain)

- here, we are interested in a specific feature of perception: flexibiliy, often studies using a adaptation paradigm

(lead over to flexibility)

- flexibility: recalibration, adaptation

-ToDo: Jiang et al. 2022 -> linked to depression

- (explain adaptation, and why its important)
- 
- previous evidence that speaker sex has an influence on vocal emotion adaptation
